# Please clone this repository diectly to your lab computer Desktop so that we can make a few plots in R
# Then, launch the lab 14 binder here [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hehouts/lab14_binder.git/HEAD/?urlpath=rstudio)
**It will take 1 - 2 minutes to load.**
**If after 2 minutes an rStudio interface does not open, try launching the binder a second time in another tab (this almost always works).** 

## Homework:
You only need to submit the `lab14_hw.Rmd`, in the `lab14_homework/` folder for credit. 
At the top of the homework, there is a link back to this binder if you want to reference it in the future. 

You can add the homework directly to your class repo by dragging the `lab14_homework/` folder into your class repository. Please knit with `.md` when you are finished.
