## Learning Goals
*At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:*    
1. Use a combination of `select()`, `filter()`, and `mutate()` to transform data frames.  
2. Use the `skimr` package to produce summaries of data.  
3. Produce clean summaries of data using `summarize()`.  
4. Use `group_by()` in combination with `summarize()` to produce grouped summaries of data.  

## Review
At this point, you should be comfortable using the functions of `dplyr`. If you need extra help, please [email me](mailto: jmledford@ucdavis.edu).  

## Load the tidyverse and janitor
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("janitor")
```

## Install `skimr`
```{r}
#install.packages("skimr")
library("skimr")
```

## Load the data
For this lab, we will use the built-in data on mammal sleep patterns. From: _V. M. Savage and G. B. West. A quantitative, theoretical framework for understanding mammalian sleep. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104 (3):1051-1056, 2007_.
```{r}
?msleep #built in data sets in R for biology, to build familiarity 
names(msleep)
```

We will also use the awesome [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html) data in the second part of lab.
```{r}
library("palmerpenguins")
palmerpenguins::penguins_raw
```

## dplyr Practice
Let's do a bit more practice to make sure that we understand `select()`, `filter()`, and `mutate()`. Start by building a new data frame `msleep24` from the `msleep` data that: contains the `name` and `vore` variables along with a new column called `sleep_total_24` which is the amount of time a species sleeps expressed as a proportion of a 24-hour day. Remove any rows with NA's and restrict the `sleep_total_24` values to less than 0.3. Arrange the output in descending order. 
```{r}
sleep <- msleep
```
```{r}
names(sleep)
```

```{r}
msleep24 <-msleep %>% 
  mutate(sleep_total_24=sleep_total/24) %>% 
  select(name,vore,sleep_total_24) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(vore)) %>%  #removing NAs from a variable
  filter(sleep_total_24 <= 0.3) %>% 
  arrange(desc(sleep_total_24)) 
msleep24
```

Did `dplyr` do what we expected? How do we check our output? Remember, just because your code runs it doesn't mean that it did what you intended.
```{r}
summary(msleep24)
```

Try out the new function `skim()` as part of the `skimr` package.
```{r}
skim(msleep24)
```

Histograms are also a quick way to check the output.
```{r}
 hist(msleep24$sleep_total_24)
```

Don't forget we can also use `tabyl()` across one or many variables.
```{r}
msleep24 %>% 
 tabyl(vore) %>% 
 adorn_pct_formatting(digits=1)
```

## Practice
1. Which taxonomic orders have species that belong to more than one class of `vore`?
```{r}
names(sleep)
```

```{r}
msleep %>% 
 tabyl(vore,order) 
```

## `summarize()`
`summarize()` will produce summary statistics for a given variable in a data frame. For example, if you are asked to calculate the mean of `sleep_total` for large and small mammals you could do this using a combination of commands, but it isn't very efficient or clean. We can do better!  
```{r}
head(msleep)
```
`

For example, if we define "large" as having a `bodywt` greater than 200 then we get the following:
```{r}
large <- 
  msleep %>% 
  select(name, genus, bodywt, sleep_total) %>% 
  filter(bodywt > 200) %>% 
  arrange(desc(bodywt))
large
```

```{r}
mean(large$sleep_total)
```

We can accomplish the same task using the `summarize()` function to make things cleaner.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  filter(bodywt > 200) %>% #large mammals
  summarize(mean_sleep_lg = mean(sleep_total)) # min, stdev, counts, etc
```

You can also combine functions to make useful summaries for multiple variables.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
    filter(bodywt > 200) %>% 
    summarize(mean_sleep_lg = mean(sleep_total), 
              min_sleep_lg = min(sleep_total),
              max_sleep_lg = max(sleep_total),
              total = n())
```

## Practice
1. What is the mean, min, and max `bodywt` for the taxonomic order Primates? Provide the total number of observations.
```{r}
names(msleep)
```

```{r}
msleep %>% 
  filter(order == "Primates") %>% 
  summarize(mean_body_wt = mean(bodywt), 
            min_body_wt = min(bodywt),
            max_body_wt = max(bodywt),
            sd_body_wt = sd(bodywt),
            total= n())
```

`n_distinct()` is a very handy way of cleanly presenting the number of distinct observations. Here we show the number of distinct genera over 100 in body weight.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  filter(bodywt > 100) %>% 
  summarise(n_genera=n_distinct(genus)) # 9 genera that have a bodyweight greater than 100
```

There are many other useful summary statistics, depending on your needs: sd(), min(), max(), median(), sum(), n() (returns the length of a column), first() (returns first value in a column), last() (returns last value in a column) and n_distinct() (number of distinct values in a column).

## Practice
1. How many genera are represented in the msleep data frame?
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  summarize(n_genera=n_distinct(genus))
```
```{r}
n_distinct(msleep$genus)
```

2. What are the min, max, and mean `sleep_total` for all of the mammals? Be sure to include the total n.
```{r}
names(msleep)
```


```{r}
msleep %>% 
  summarize(sleep_min =min(sleep_total),
            sleep_max =max(sleep_total),
            sleep_mean =mean(sleep_total),
            total=n())
```

## `group_by()`
The `summarize()` function is most useful when used in conjunction with `group_by()`. Although producing a summary of body weight for all of the mammals in the data set is helpful, what if we were interested in body weight by feeding ecology? 
grouping all of the animals with the same type of feeding
```{r}
msleep %>%
  group_by(vore) %>% #we are grouping by feeding ecology, a categorical variable, takes all of the carnivores, herbivores, insectivores and clusters them for you
  summarize(min_bodywt = min(bodywt),
            max_bodywt = max(bodywt),
            mean_bodywt = mean(bodywt),
            total=n()) # leaving NAs in there (how do we know what that animal eats?)
```

## Practice
1. Calculate mean brain weight by taxonomic order in the msleep data.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  group_by(order) %>% 
  summarize(meanbrain_weight= mean(brainwt))
```

2. What does `NA` mean? How are NA's being treated by the summarize function?
NA means not applicable or not listed, its kept for the entire function
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  filter(order == "Carnivora") %>% 
  select(order, genus, brainwt)
```

3. Try running the code again, but this time add `na.rm=TRUE`. What is the problem with Cetacea? Compare this to Carnivora. 
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  group_by(order) %>% 
  summarize(meanbrain_weight= mean(brainwt, na.rm= T))
```
Cetacea has NA in the mean brain weight but na.rm says it removed the NA. 3 counts of NA
Carnivora also has the same, it has 12 counts of NA

```{r}
msleep %>% 
  filter(order == "Cetacea") %>% 
  select(order, name, genus, brainwt)
```

## That's it! Let's take a break and then move on to part 2!
