## Review from last time
### *With a partner, discuss the following questions*
1. How is a data frame and how is it different than a data matrix?  
Data frame is like a better way of presenting data, as it tells you what class of data it is at the top and is organized visually to be more user friendly. Resembles a spreadsheet, includes more information than a data matrix.

2. What is the command we use to import .csv files into R?  
readr : : read_csv("file")
package is readr :: read_csv ("pathway") 
can recognize the file 

3. Take a moment to show your repository on GitHub to a partner. Can you make any improvements?  

## Warm-up
1. In a new R Markdown document, load the tidyverse and a package called `palmerpenguins`.
2. What are the dimensions of the dataset `penguins`?
3. What are the names of the variables in the `penguins` dataset?
4. How many individuals were sampled on each island in the `penguins` dataset?
5. What is the mean body mass for all individuals in the `penguins` dataset?
