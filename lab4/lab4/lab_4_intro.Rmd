## Review from last time
### *With a partner, discuss the following questions*
1. How is a data frame and how is it different than a data matrix?  
2. What is the command we use to import .csv files into R?  
3. Take a moment to show your repository on GitHub to a partner. Can you make any improvements?  

## Warm-up
1. In a new R Markdown document, load the tidyverse and a package called `palmerpenguins`.
2. What are the dimensions of the dataset `penguins`?
3. What are the names of the variables in the `penguins` dataset?
4. How many individuals were sampled on each island in the `penguins` dataset?
5. What is the mean body mass for all individuals in the `penguins` dataset?
